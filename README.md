# JS Hooks <!-- omit in toc -->
Configurations and Scripts for hooks.

## Usage

### Considerations
I use these hooks with `husky`, but you are free to integrate them with any trigger logic of your own an modify them as you please. This is just an implementation that I've been using and iterating across my projects.

### Installation
There's no need to add this package as a dependency in your project. Simply run
```sh
npx js-hooks
```
